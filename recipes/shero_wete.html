    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fragrant Ethiopian chickpea stew with warm spices that comes together in 45 minutes. 
        Vegan, gluten-free and a delicious but hearty meal that everyone will love!</p>
    <p>Shiro Wat, also known as Shuro or Shiro Wot, is a staple in any Ethiopian vegetarian 
        platter - a thick, chickpea stew simmered slowly and served 
        over their traditional sour flatbread, injera, with a host of other vegetarian dishes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>chickpea flour</li>
        <li>berbere powder</li>
        <li>garlic powder</li>
        <li>ground cardamom</li>
        <li>cumin powder</li>
        <li>you'll need olive oil</li>
        <li>onions</li>
        <li>tomato paste</li>
        <li>minced garlic and salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Start by making shiro powder
                    </h4>
            <p>Shiro powder is the foundation of this dish. I strongly recommend dry 
            toasting chickpea flour to start, along with a tablespoon of berbere spice, 
            and a teaspoon each of ground cardamom, cumin powder, 
            and garlic powder. Set aside. You can either add the salt here, or later.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat a medium sized pot (or Dutch oven) on medium heat. 
                Then, add olive oil and heat it up for a minute. Add a 
                diced onion, and sauté over low to medium heat for a few minutes until fragrant. 
                The smaller you can dice your onions the better. Or, you can also puree the onions 
                and add that instead! Then, add minced garlic along with tomato paste and 
                sauté for a minute until garlic is fragrant.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Then, add the shiro powder, salt, and three cups of water. Bring this to a boil on medium heat, then turn the heat down and let the mixture simmer for 20 or 30 minutes (depends on the strength of the stove and the consistency you prefer!) Make sure to stir at five minute increments, so it doesn't stick.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>the olive oil will float to the top when the shiro is done cooking!</p>
            <p>Serve hot with rice or injera (and stay tuned for my traditional and/or quick injera recipes!</p>
